<h1>Closing the Loop</h1>
<h2>
  <strong>Tina Huang</strong> </h2>

<p class="intro">When Grayson Welo was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, she found herself saddled with a bag of devices to monitor and support her pancreatic functions. However, the introduction of the RileyLink, which serves as a translator between her insulin pump and smartphone, has allowed her to leave the bag at home. Welo discusses how the RileyLink has impacted her life as a diabetic and its implications for the future of biotechnology.
